# chance: chance to spawn a crate per newly generated chunk.
# chance âˆˆ [0, 100]
# so a chance of 2 will be a 2% chance to spawn in a new chunk
# - = - = - = WARNING = - = - = -
#  - setting the value for generation.<world>.chance to values higher values will increase lagg.
#    literally, setting the value to 75 will likely crash the server
